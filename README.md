## How It's Made
After the user submits a word, the server then uses the logic stored within the POST method to figure out whether it's a palindrome, and saves the word and results to the database. Moving forward, the computer uses 4 methods (loading the home page, posting the word, update the confusion marks, and delete the words) to send responses back to the client, depending on the user's requests.

## What I Learned
This was similar to my past applications so creating this just really allowed me to get more comfortable with the material. This was the first time I had included logic within my HTTP methods but it wasn't too new from what I would usually do, just different organization.
